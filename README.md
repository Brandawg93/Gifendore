## Directions
The gifendore bot works by replying to a mention with the last frame of a video or gif. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore/comments/axcqvs/example_of_ugifendore/) is an example of what it can do.

Summon [u/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/u/gifendore) by mentioning its name on a link submission.

You can use [r/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore) to test gifendore if you like.

## Commands
Add any of these commands to the end of the mention (e.g. u/gifendore freeze)
- help: see a help message.
- x: replace x with any number to go back x seconds in the gif.
- x-y: replace x and y with any numbers to get a smaller section of the gif.
- reverse: get the gif in reverse.
- slowmo: get the gif in slow motion.
- freeze: freeze the end of a gif.
- Press *edit* to edit its original message (Can only be done by the OP).
- Press *delete* to remove the bot's message (Can only be done by the OP).

## Subreddit Moderators
- If you add the bot as a mod to your subreddit, it will automatically comment and sticky itself on every post.
- Please let me know if you would like to use the bot on your subreddit.
- The bot will automatically delete its comment if it is either downvoted too much or the post is removed.

## Limitations
- Currently supported sites
  - reddit direct uploads
  - imgur
  - gfycat
  - streamable
  - any direct link to a .gif or .mp4
  - **NEW** The bot can grab a high resolution thumbnail of youtube videos
- The bot doesn't work in anti-bot subs. If you summon the bot and it doesn't reply, it will crosspost to [r/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore) and attempt to pm you. Otherwise, simply crosspost to [r/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore) and it will automatically reply.

## FAQ
**Q:** Where is the bot hosted?

**A:** It is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with code on [Github](https://github.com/Brandawg93/Gifendore).

**Q:** How do I get X seconds from the end of a gif?

**A:** Just add X to the end of the mention (e.g. u/gifendore X)

**Q:** Can the bot be used on my subreddit for every post?

## Notes
- If you run into any issues with the bot, please let me know [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/u/brandawg93&subject=Gifendore%20Issue&message=Please%20submit%20any%20issues%20you%20may%20have%20with%20u/gifendore%20here%20along%20with%20a%20link%20to%20the%20original%20post.) by sending a link to the post that causes the error.

- If you find any subs where the bot doesn't reply back (because it's more than likely banned) please let me know.

- [u/gifendore_testing](https://www.reddit.com/u/gifendore_testing) only works for mods so there's no point in trying.
