# Gifendore Overview

## Directions:

The gifendore bot works by replying to a mention with the last frame of a video or gif. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore/comments/axcqvs/example_of_ugifendore/) is an example of what it can do.

Summon [u/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/u/gifendore) by mentioning its name on a link submission.

You can use [r/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore) to test gifendore if you like.

## Commands:
- Call the bot with a number to go back in time within the gif. (e.g. u/gifendore 3.5)
- Reply to the bot's reply to edit its original message.
- Reply with "delete" to remove the bot's message.


## Limitations:

- The bot only works on link submissions:

  - The file must be a gif or video (preferably an mp4).

  - The link must either be a direct upload or from imgur or gfycat.

    - **NEW:** It will now attempt to work on any website as long as it is a gif.

  - The bot doesn't work in anti-bot subs. If you summon the bot and it doesn't reply, it will crosspost to [r/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore) and attempt to pm you. Otherwise, simply crosspost to [r/gifendore](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifendore) and it will automatically reply.


## Notes:

- When there is an error, the bot will reply with (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ and sometimes give a reason for the error.

- **This bot is still in beta.** If you run into any issues with the bot, please let me know [here](https://s.reddit.com/channel/1698661_674bd7a57e2751c0cc0cca80e84fade432f276e3) by sending a link to the post that causes the error.

- If you find any subs where the bot doesn't reply back (because it's more than likely banned) please let me know.

- [u/gifendore_testing](https://www.reddit.com/u/gifendore_testing) only works for mods so there's no point in trying.
